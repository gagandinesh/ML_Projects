1) Name of Project --- Sonar Detection for Underwater Mines and Stones

2) Aim of Project is to classify which is Rock and Mines from under the water

3) Workflow---

   i)  Collect Dataset 

   ii) Pre-Process the Data

   iii) Split the Data-- Train and Test Data

   iv) Selection of ML model --- In this we have chosen "Logistic Regression Model" 

    v) Providing New Data for the trained Model for Prediction


4) Why Logistic Regression Model ??

  -->>
 
     It is a Supervised ML Algorithm 

      It works well in case of Binary classification Model 


Result Obtained 

i) On Training Data = 0.8342245989304813

ii) On Test Data = 0.7619047619047619


On using The Predictive Model we are able Distinguish Between "Rock" and "Mines" 

['M']
The object is a Mine

or

['R']
The object is a Rock
