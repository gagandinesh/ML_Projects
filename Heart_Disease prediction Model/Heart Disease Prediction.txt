1) Name of the Project -- Heart Disease Prediction 

2) Aim of the Project --- To Find Which Patient is Suffering from an heart Disease (0--> Healthy,1-->Not Healthy)

3) Workflow --

   i) Collect Heart Dataset  (Which Contains Several parameters)  [Dataset obtained from Kaggle]
 
   ii) Pre-Processing of the Data 

   iii) Split the data into training and Test Data

   iv) Selection of ML Model -- In this project we have used " Logistic Regression Model "

   v) Providing New Data for the trained Model for Prediction


4) Why we Have Used Logistic Regression?

--->   Because We are Gonna Get the results in Binary for (Yes/No)


5)  Accuracy Scored Obtained.

     i) Accuracy on Training data :  0.8512396694214877

    ii) Accuracy on Test data :  0.819672131147541
           

5)  Model Prediction Obtained.
