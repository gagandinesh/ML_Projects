1) Name of the Project -- Movie Recommendation System (Content Based Recommendation System)
 
2) Aim of the Project --- To Recommend an Movie for an user based on the user interest 

3) Workflow --

   i) Collect Movie Dataset
 
   ii) Pre-Processing of the Data ( finding of Null values and cleaning of Data
   
   iii) Feature Extraction ( Since the Dataset is in Textual data we need to Convert them into Numerical Vectors)

   iv) Cosine Similarity ( we use this to Find the Similar  type of Movie Entered by the user)  

 
4)  why we are not using any ML Model here??

    we are using Cosine Similarity Algorithm 
    The "cosine similarity algorithm" is a computational method used to determine the degree of similarity between two vectors by evaluating the cosine of the angle between them.
