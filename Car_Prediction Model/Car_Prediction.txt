1) Name of the Project -- Used cars Price Prediction

2) Aim of the Project --- Finding the best Price of Used Car based on Brand,Year,KMS Driven 

3) Workflow --

   i) Collect Car Dataset
 
   ii) Pre-Processing of the Data

   iii) Split the data into training and Test Data

   iv) Selection of ML Model -- In this project we have used "Linear and Lasso Regression Model"

   v) Providing New Data for the trained Model for Prediction
