1 )Name of the Project -- Diabetes Prediction ML Model

2) Aim of the Project -- To Find out the People who are Diabetic based on the give symptoms

3) Workflow --

   i)  Collect Dataset ( The Dataset used contains only "Females Symptoms")

   ii) Pre-Process the Data (In this We need to Standardize the data)

   iii) Split the Data-- Train and Test Data

   iv) Selection of ML model --- In this we have chosen "Support Vector Machine Classifier" 

   v) Providing New Data for the trained Model for Prediction


4) Why SVM is used??

>>
   SVM has a Property of Classifying the data given

   It uses the Concept of Hyperplane for Classification and Prediction 

   In the Above Model we can Get the result as Weather the Patient is "Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic"



5) Result Obtained (Accuracy)


   i) On Training Data = 0.7866449511400652


   ii) On Test Data = 0.7727272727272727


6)  Prediction Obtained Based on Predictive Model with Input Data Entered

Note -- 1 represents the Patient is diabetic  and  0 represents the patient is Not Diabetic


     [0]
         The patient is "Not Diabetic" Stay Healthy

        Else 

     [1]
        The patient is "Diabetic" Visit the Hospital ASAP
