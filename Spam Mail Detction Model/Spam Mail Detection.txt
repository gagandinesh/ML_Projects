1) Name of the Project -- Spam Mail Detection

2) Aim of the Project ---  To Classify Between the Incoming Mails are Spam Mails or Real Mails and Send them to Respective Folders

3) Workflow --

   i) Collect Mail Dataset
 
   ii) Pre-Processing of the Data

   iii) Split the data into training and Test Data

   iv) Selection of ML Model -- Logistic Regression Model

   v) Providing New Data for the trained Model for Prediction


4) Why we have used Logistic regression model..?
   
    We have used logistic Regression Model because they help in "Binary classification" (i.e. they return 2 values (0/1) or (True/False)


5) Model Evaluation 


 I) ON Training Data

    Accuracy on Training Data :  0.9676912721561588

II) ON Test Data
 
    Accuracy on Test Data :  0.9668161434977578


6) Final Prediction of Model on New Data/ Message  [if [0]--> Ham Mail , [1] --> Spam Mail ]
